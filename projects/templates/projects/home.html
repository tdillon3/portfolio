        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Growing up there was always that intense desire to know how things worked and how things were put together. As a child, it was with tinker toys and Lincoln logs and now it is with computer parts and programming. It always starts small with a simple question like, “How does that work?” or “How can this be fixed?” 
            Finding my career path while attending Brigham Young University of Idaho was one of the great self-discoveries to date. Knowing that getting down to the root of the problem and then designing a solution for it was what I was made for excites me every day. Utilizing the power of analysis and organization, anything can be made or fixed with Software Design and Engineering. With experience in Law Enforcement, attention to detail only enhances these abilities.
            You will find me constantly diving into new concepts and problems to find a solution through software. The future of technology is always evolving, and I'm excited to be part of it. Learning and growing with technology is essential. There is always a way, the goal always exists, finding the way and getting to your goal is the fun part.
