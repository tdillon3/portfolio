# Overview

As a budding software engineer, my primary goal is to continuously deepen my understanding of software development and design. This personal portfolio project is a testament to that effort, aiming to showcase my skills, experience, and enthusiasm for software development. 

This web application acts as a digital representation of my professional journey, highlighting my achievements, projects, and skills. To run the web application on a local machine:
1. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Run the command: `python manage.py runserver`
3. Open a browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to view the landing page of the application.

The primary purpose of this software is to offer potential employers and other stakeholders a glimpse into my capabilities as a software engineer, illustrating both my technical prowess and my ability to design user-centric applications.
